        <h3>Raiders of The Lost Ark</h3>
        <p>
          The year is 1936. An archeology professor named Indiana Jones is venturing in the jungles of South America searching for
        a golden statue. Unfortunately, he sets off a deadly trap but miraculously escapes. Then, Jones hears from a museum
        curator named Marcus Brody about a biblical artifact called The Ark of the Covenant, which can hold the key to human
        existence. Jones has to venture to vast places such as Nepal and Egypt to find this artifact. However, he will have to
        fight his enemy Rene Belloq and a band of Nazis in order to reach it.

        <h3>Temple of Doom</h3>
        <p>
          One short year before the explosive adventure in Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), the undaunted professor of archaeology,
    Dr Indiana Jones, ends up in far-off India, after having a narrow escape from death in 1935 Hong Kong. Along with his
    trusty twelve-year-old sidekick, Short Round, and the utterly unprepared nightclub singer, Willie Scott, Indiana embarks
    on a peril-laden quest to retrieve the sacred Sankara Stone stolen from the shrine of an impoverished Indian community
    and the village's kidnapped children. Now, as the evil Thuggee cult spreads its tentacles over the region, and even in
    the opulent Palace of Pankot, Indy and his team must brave swarms of disgusting creepy crawlies, an army of
    armed-to-the-teeth zealots, and unspeakable subterranean terrors. Will Indiana Jones get out of the cursed Temple of
    Doom in one piece, and live to tell the tale?

        <h3>The Last Crusade</h3>
        <p>
          An art collector appeals to Jones to embark on a search for the Holy Grail. He learns that another archaeologist has
        disappeared while searching for the precious goblet, and the missing man is his own father, Dr. Henry Jones. The
        artifact is much harder to find than they expected, and its powers are too much for those impure in heart.
